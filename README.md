Open Systems Security – an Architectural Framework. PhD Thesis by Arto T. Karila

http://blog.postmaster.gr/2009/11/02/open-systems-security-an-architectural-framework/

“In the old days” when security information was scarce and many of us began
shaping our security mentality (be it white, gray or black) by reading
“Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into it” and the Computer
Security FAQ and running tools like iss and Crack. I think it was there that I
first read about Arto Karila’s PhD thesis. Even though it is an OSI based
document, it helped understand basic concepts. However there were two
problems with the document:

1. It was hard to find, and

2. It was in a weird PostScript format that even modern versions of
ghostscript refuse to display.

With the help of a friend I managed to transform it to PDF.

Of historical value mostly.
